# Teaching-Chatbot

Chatbots in various industries have benefited humans in many ways. 
Due to the drawback of template-based chatbots, NLP chatbots are implemented. They are 
more enthusiastic due to their ability to learn human ways of speaking and can naturally 
communicate with users. In this project, NLP and deep learning-based NLP chatbots are 
implemented and put into comparison to select the best chatbot that can answer students’ 
questions effectively. After the comparison, it is found that a deep learning-based chatbot with 
a deep neural network of SGD optimiser and activation function tanh and softmax has the 
highest accuracy and the slightest errors. Within the training model for 50, 100, 200 and 500 
epochs, it is found that the model with 500 epochs performs better than the others. Hence, with 
such a model, it is believed that the Tutor Chatbot can assist students in their studies and 
achieve higher academic grades.
